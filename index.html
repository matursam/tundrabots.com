                        FTC Robotics Resource is a project for new teams created by FTC Team #7083, The Tundrabots.  After 4 years in FTC and 6 years in FIRST all together, we felt that it was time to share all of the knowledge we've acquired with new teams.  We hope that this site is a useful resource for teams that are just starting out.

                                FIRST Tech Challenge is a robotics competition for high schoolers, designed to be a “varsity sport for the mind”.
                                FTC focuses on creating a team-based, sports-like competition for teenagers interested in STEM fields.
                                As a part of the competition, teams are exposed to mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, as well as marketing and teamwork.

                                If you are planning to create a team you may not know where to start. If you are a
                                potential coach you may need to find people to be on the team or be worried about
                                funding. If you are a student who wishes to start a team you will also have to deal
                                with these issues. However it is not as daunting as it sounds robotics is intriguing
                                and. When reaching out to potential members first and foremost you have to really
                                consider whether they would mesh with your other team members. Second then you consider
                                who they are. I know this is strange question but from our experience we have found that
                                there are 5 different types of people in robotics but many often take multiple of these
                                roles or share them. These roles are manager, wiring, team leader, builder and programmer.
                                <br><br>
                                The manager manages the engineering notebook and other paperwork this job can also
                                include outreach and fundraising. Wiring is in charge of the control system of the
                                robot they work closely with the builders to integrate the control elements into the
                                design. The team leader is only needed for some teams and really depends on your team
                                dynamic. This job is to direct the overall operations of the team. The builder is a role
                                that is often taken up by a main builder and many other members of the team there job is
                                to manage the physical robot and to build it (duh). The final position is the programer
                                their job is to program the robot this job to manage write the program for the robot. I
                                must emphasize that these are rough and should not be followed to the letter. Another
                                thing to think about is team dynamic this grows naturally but should be considered when
                                adding team members.

                                Fundraising is one of the most crucial parts of having a successful FTC team. Without it, teams would have thousands of dollars to pay out of their own pockets. Many local tech companies offer some kind of grant to FIRST teams, the hard part is just finding those companies that do offer grants. The easiest way to find companies that offer grants is calling them. Most receptionists know if they offer grants or not but it’s easiest to just ask to speak to a manager in charge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Setting up a meeting with companies is very beneficial. Try to schedule a day for the team to come demonstrate a robot (having a dedicated demo robot for this is a great idea) and have a brief presentation about FIRST, as well as explain to the company what their funding would be used for. Throughout the season, parts, registration fees, and travel expenses are well, expensive. Usually, the necessary funds to support a team through a full season is between $1,000-$2,000 dollars. Around 1-5 grants will probably cover those expenses. Below is a list of companies with known FIRST grants available.

                                Robot design is easily one of the most important parts of FTC is designing and building the robot itself. Many teams use different methods of constructing their own unique robot design, but there’s no single“best way” to go about doing it. Each team must determine what works for them. The following are a few tips and different ways to approach designing the robot:
                                <br>
                                <ul class="list-group">
                                    <li class="list-group-item">1) Go over each thing that can be done in each portion of the match (autonomous, teleop, and endgame), and organize them based on obtainable points and perceived difficulty. Prioritize which parts of the game are worth focusing on.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">2) Now that the optimal methods of scoring points have been determined, the mechanisms needed to complete those tasks can begin the brainstorming phase. Every possible idea that could work for each task should be written down. After a sufficient amount of ideas have been produced, the process of narrowing them down can begin. All of the “less than ideal” ideas can be eliminated until only valid ones remain.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item">3) If there is more than one idea that makes it through the brainstorming phase, the team can split up into smaller groups with each one focusing on one design. This will help determine the validity of each idea, making it easier to choose a single option.</li>
                                </ul>

                                Outreach is a very important aspect of FIRST, and is an essential part of every successful team’s season. The gist of outreach is to promote FIRST in the community and beyond.  This is usually accomplished by demonstrating robots at different places (for instance, we’ve done outreach at the Durham Regional Library, and a neighborhood clubhouse as some examples).  It’s really easy to find events, and it helps especially to network with other teams.  More experienced teams tend to set up and host outreach events, and will sometimes invite other teams. It is also possible contact your state’s FIRST organizers, as they usually have events where people can participate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes, it is more convenient to contact local communities in person to promote FIRST.  Our team personally, as an example, have demonstrated our robot to a local Boy Scout troop.  While the gist of Outreach is to promote FIRST, there are other events and activities which are considered outreach.  One example of this would be to meet with engineers in the local area to learn more about the process of S.T.E.M., where it leads, and what it means to work in S.T.E.M.  All in all, Outreach is a very fun experience and essential to an FTC team’s season.

                                FTC tournaments are usually broken into two sections: qualification matches and elimination matches. Both have some similarities, but from a strategy perspective the two are very different. Learning the strategies required to succeed in each portion is essential to success, especially at state levels and beyond.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the qualifying matches, teams are paired at random, and play only one match with each partner. Since the partners are selected randomly, teams don’t have any control over their alliances overall capabilities, aside from ensuring that their own robot is capable of doing as many different tasks as possible without relying on the partner. However, teamwork is still essential in this phase of the tournament. Tournaments generally publish the match schedule the morning of the competition, an hour or so before matches begin.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once the match schedule is available, teams should immediately all matches they’re going to be a part of, the robots which will be partnered with them during these matches, and the opponents they’ll be facing. Before the match starts, it’s a very good idea for the drive team from each allied team to meet and discuss their robots capabilities, particularly in autonomous. The sooner the meeting, the better; if the team’s autonomous programs will overlap, one or both teams will need time to make adjustments so that they can run both programs. If both teams have identical autonomous programs, and they can’t both run them, then it’s important to identify which team has the more consistent program.

                                Elimination matches, on the other hand, allow for deeper strategy since the teams choose to work together instead of being paired at random. In theory, the teams will have compatible strategies in teleop and autonomous. If the tournament is large enough, there will be 3 teams per alliance, which does complicate things a little. Since each round is a “best of 3”, and all 3 teams are required to play in at least one match, most alliances will run their best two robots in their first match, their best and worst robot in the next match, and if there’s a third match in the series they’ll run their 2 best again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This isn’t a terrible strategy, but in some instances it’s better to run the less effective team first and the more effective team second. This strategy is often effective for the fourth seed alliance, as they usually have 1 good robot and two mediocre robots, and by running their good robot against the other team’s weaker combination. This gives them the best chance of getting one win and pushing the match into a third round where they can run their best team. This way, they only have to beat their opponent's strongest team once. Furthermore, if something malfunctions on the opposing alliance’s robot during the first round, as often happens, and the weaker combination wins, the fourth seed has very good odds to beat the top seed 2-0.

                                One final consideration: having a dedicated drive team is incredibly important. Many teams make the mistake of rotating drivers throughout the rest of the day. By doing this, they ensure that none of their drivers are particularly competent. Having a dedicated driver who practices throughout the season will exponentially improve performance in matches. Driver competence is one of the biggest differences between successful and unsuccessful teams.

                                There are four main sections of competition days, Pit Management, Judging, Scouting, and Matches. Each section is wildly important to a team’s success at competitions. While competing, one of the most important concepts is “Gracious Professionalism” which basically means be as nice to everyone as possible.

                                The first part of the entire competition is unloading teams and their gear into the pits. It is beneficial to keep the pit area clean, so it is more accessible from every direction. This allows all team members to be able to work on scouting sheets, the robot, and whatever else they see fit. A clean pit is the way to go here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After all teams have unpacked, judging will begin. In judging, teams will give an interview to a panel of (usually 2-3) of judges. This interview covers whatever the team feels like the judges need to know about their robot, code, outreach, and fundraising. These interviews aren’t particularly long (only about 10 minutes) so most teams try to keep it around 5-7 mins to allow judges to ask questions about specific things that interested them about the team. The judges tend to ask questions from a variety of topics so it would be beneficial to be well versed in your team.

                                Scouting is crucial for every team. Without scouting, disaster could strike during the alliance selection portion of the competition. Ideally, teams devote 2-3 members to scouting all other teams at the competition, paying extra attention to teams that are opponents, allies, and teams that are complimentary to your robot and it’s abilities. Scouting is very important to how the competition pans out. Each team participates in 5 qualifying matches. As the day goes on, it becomes clear which teams are better than the rest of the field. After all teams complete their qualifying matches, the top 4 teams at the tournament begin what is called the “Alliance Selection”. In the alliance selection, the top 4 teams pick 1 (or in some cases 2) team to join them for the elimination matches. The elimination matches determine who advances from the tournament.
